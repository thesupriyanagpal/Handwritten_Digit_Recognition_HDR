# 🖊 Handwritten Digit Recognition (HDR) Project

## 📜 Project Description

The Digit Recognition project aims to create a system capable of accurately identifying handwritten digits. The process involves:

- 📥 Collecting a dataset of handwritten digit images, such as the MNIST dataset, labeled with their corresponding digits.
- 🛠️ Applying preprocessing techniques like normalization and resizing to standardize the images.
- 🔍 Extracting features from the images using techniques such as pixel intensities, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and edge detection.
- 🧠 Training machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, or deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), on the extracted features.
- 📈 Evaluating the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
- 🔧 Fine-tuning the model and optimizing hyperparameters to improve its accuracy.
- 🚀 Deploying the trained model into a real-world application that can accurately recognize handwritten digits in real-time.

### ⚙️ Features
1. Pixel Intensities:
  - 🎨 The most straightforward feature is the intensity value of each pixel in the image.
  - ⚫ Each pixel’s intensity serves as a feature, with grayscale images having values ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
2. HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients):
  - 🧭 A feature descriptor used to capture shape information in an image.
  - 🌀 Computes the distribution of gradient orientations in localized portions of the image.
3. Edge Detection:
  -  🖼️ Features are derived from detected edges within the image using techniques like Sobel, Canny, or Prewitt edge detectors.
4. Corner Detection:
  - 🧩 Features can be extracted from corner points in the image using algorithms like the Harris corner detector.
5. Texture Features:
  - 🧵 Texture information is captured using techniques such as co-occurrence matrices or local binary patterns (LBP).
6. Zernike Moments:
  - 🔮 Zernike moments are orthogonal moments used to capture shape information, especially effective for binary images.

### 📊 Model Performance Evaluation
